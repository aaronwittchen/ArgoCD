# This file references the official ArgoCD installation manifest
# We use a remote base to stay up-to-date with ArgoCD releases

# To install ArgoCD, this kustomization pulls from the official release
# You can pin to a specific version or use 'stable' for latest stable

# The actual manifest is pulled from:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

# We'll reference it in kustomization.yaml as a remote resource
